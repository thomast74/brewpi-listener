# brewpi-listener
This is the repository for the BrewPi Listener script. The python script listens to udp broadcast status messages from BrewPi Sparks on the local network.The status messages are handed over to the BrewPi WebApp Server. This supports the automatic discovery of BrewPi Sparks for configuration through the BrewPi WebApp.
